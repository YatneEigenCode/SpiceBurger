This page demonstrates
that GitHub.io can be used
to host multiple pages 
(not web app back end).
<p>
This file is saved in 
the root folder of the repository.
<p>
Another file tu.htm is saved in 
the same folder. You can see
that it's accessible using
this link 
<a href="tu.htm">tu.htm</a> 
in a browser.
<p>
Other files in sub folders 
are accessible also.
<p>
Github limits you to 
one website per user. 
Each project will be accessed
via a subdirectory 
under the website. 
But if you want a project to 
appear as unrelated
to your other projects, 
use an external domain service
(like godaddy) to set up 
a domain or subdomain that
points to one project in GitHub.io 
physical host.
<p>
While it may seem more convenient
to use a single provider turn key 
hosting and domain (and storage) 
solution, it will become apparent
later why separation of responsibilities
is ultimately better 
for the owner operator. The timing
will create obstacles that will
force your decision to stay with 
an interior setup as a trade-off
for risks of migration.
